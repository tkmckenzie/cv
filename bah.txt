Hello,
I am a cybersecurity researcher at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. My background is in economics and statistics, and my work at Sandia has involved developing methods to quantify risk and resilience as well as analyzing reproducibility of critical analyses and structuring studies to ensure they are replicable and properly quantify uncertainty.

I have recently been looking for other job opportunities that more closely align with background and interests and allow me to support a greater range of projects and objectives.
