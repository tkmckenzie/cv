\noindent Dear HowNot2 Team,\\

My career and work reflects my passion for understanding, quantifying, and communicating risk to inform and improve decision-making. In my current role at Sandia National Laboratories, I leverage my expertise in systemic risk analysis and strategic foresight to inform decision-makers and stakeholders about current and future risks posed to high-consequence systems like critical infrastructure and national security systems, enabling them to both more effectively operate their systems today and prepare their systems for a challenging and uncertain future. I have been involved in many of these analyses, but I am most proud of my role as nuclear safety expert on the Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Board, which is responsible for understanding and communicating risk posed to the public of launches of spacecraft containing nuclear material, including most recently the Mars 2020 mission that landed the Perseverance Rover on Mars in February 2021. As a part of that analysis, I led an examination of uncertainty around launch accident outcomes and how much plutonium might be released. The process involved poring over design documentation to understand when and how the system could fail, engaging with a wide array of experts to XXXX, and designing statistical analyses to extract the most useful information possible from very limited experimental data. Our efforts culminated in a new methodology and a substantially improved understanding of risk posed to the public, and the analysis was delivered to the President of the United States to inform their decision of whether the mission was worth the risk.

Of course, the true value of a risk analysis is only realized if findings can be effectively conveyed to decision-makers and stakeholders, and we developed data visualizations 

My experience in risk analysis
