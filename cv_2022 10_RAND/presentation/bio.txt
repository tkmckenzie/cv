He earned his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Oregon in 2017, focusing on decision and choice modeling and empirically describing competition between firms and other economic agents. At Sandia, Taylor has leveraged his economics and statistics expertise across a wide range of applications, including contributing to risk analysis of the launch of the Perseverance rover as a member of the Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Board, performing economic impact analyses of COVID-19 and other natural and man-made disasters, and contributing to Global Futures studies on space and collective security to inform Sandia’s policies and direction.
