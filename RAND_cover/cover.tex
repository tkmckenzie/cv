\subsection*{RAND Corporation}

To Whom It May Concern: \\

I am writing to express strong interest in the research economist position at the RAND Corporation.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Oregon in 2017, pursuing research in Industrial Organization and Applied Econometrics. I have since been employed at Sandia National Laboratories as a Senior Cybersecurity Researcher. During that time, I used and improved my knowledge of economic and statistical analyses while also developing skills relevant to cybersecurity. I gained greater understanding of cyber-attack vectors through cybersecurity training and further advanced those abilities through resilience analyses of cyber-dependent systems and red teaming exercises. I also contributed to economic disaster analyses and built robust statistical models for a variety of applications, learning and developing new methodologies in the process. Each of these efforts involved working on teams with diverse backgrounds, drawing on many sources of expertise, identifying and 

I look forward to applying my economic and statistical expertise and cybersecurity experience to diverse and challenging projects at RAND. I am excited to work together with talented teams with many specializations to arrive at novel and well-founded results.

\noindent Sincerely,\\

\noindent Taylor McKenzie
